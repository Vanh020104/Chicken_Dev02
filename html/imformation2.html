                        <p class="about-text">The Parodia magnifica genus includes a multitude of showy and easy-to-grow small ball cacti. 
                            Their round appearance is to credit for their shapely name, and they can grow in pots in clusters up to over a foot wide. 
                            Ball cacti are moderate growers, adding about four inches to their height each year. Older plants will frequently produce flowers in beautiful 
                            shades of yellow, red, orange, or pink, and all varietals feature ridges of spikes that start white and grow to a yellow-brown with age.</p>
                       
                             <p class="about-text">
                            Philodendron xanadu is commonly confused with its close relative, the philodendron selloum (Thaumatophyllum selloum). Both have large, 
                            deeply lobed leaves, however, there are a few distinct differences that can help you tell these tropical plants apart. 
                            First, their growth habits are drastically different. The philodendron selloum, also known as philodendron bipinnatifidum, 
                            has a climbing growth habit, developing a thick trunk and large aerial roots as it matures. In contrast, the philodendron 
                            xanadu has a more shrub-like growth habit, remaining relatively compact and bushy without climbing. Second, the philodendron
                            selloum grows significantly larger than the xanadu—reaching several meters at maturity—while the xanadu usually tops out at around
                            five feet tall. Lastly, while both plants are known for their large foliage the xanadu 
                            has slightly smaller and narrower leaves than the selloum, although the shapes are very similar.

                        <h2 class="about-title">Ball Cactus Care</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Native to central South America, they are easy to care for, making them excellent beginner cacti. 
                            If you can grow cacti and succulents successfully, you can likely grow the popular ball cactus without too much trouble. 
                            It's important to remember that the ball cactus doesn't like direct sunlight and is accustomed to more water than many other cacti species. However, the cactus mustn't be exposed 
                            to prolonged dampness or sitting water. Never let your cactus sit in a dish of water, and take care to ensure its soil is very well-draining. <br>
                        <br> While they prefer a warm and dry climate, they are more adaptable than some of their cacti cousins,
                         able to withstand temperatures that hover around freezing as long as they're kept dry.
                         <br> <br>
                         To encourage better flowering, allow the plants to enjoy a cooling period in the winter and dramatically cut back on watering cadence. Lastly, make sure to fertilize during the growing season for the best results.

                             <h2 class="about-title">Light</h2>
                      
                             <p class="about-text">Like many cacti, the ball cactus prefers a mix of airy, dry soil. 
                                Drainage is especially important as well, so if you're opting for a store-bought blend (cacti or succulent-specific mix is your best bet), 
                                consider adding coarse sand, perlite, or pumice to the mixture to help aerate the soil. Overall, 
                                the soil's pH level isn't important to the ball cactus. However, it thrives best in a slightly acidic mixture with a pH between 6.1 and 6.5.
                        </p>
                       
                        <h2 class="about-title">Soil</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Choose a soil mix that is rich, airy, and well-draining while still retaining some moisture. 
                            A combination of equal parts indoor potting soil, perlite, and orchid bark is a great option 
                            that you can easily whip up at home. Alternatively, 
                            any ready-made soil mix that is designed for aroids is a great option.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="about-title">Water</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Ball cacti are drought tolerant but they do like water during their growing season. Provide regular water during the spring and summer months, but only when the soil is dry to the touch, thoroughly soaking the soil through when you do water. In the winter the cactus will go dormant and need very little water, so you can cease regular watering and let the soil become very dry between waterings, but do not let 
                            it completely dry out. If the cactus is planted in a container, make sure there are several holes in the bottom of the pot to aid in drainage.
                                 </p>
                
                            <h2 class="about-title">Temperature and Humidity</h2>
                            <p class="about-text fs-20">True to their nature, ball cacti prefer warm, desert-like conditions. That being said, they can survive below-freezing 
                                temperatures as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit, though it's not recommended that they're kept that cold for very long at all. <br> <br>
                                Dry heat is the key to keeping any cactus, and ball cacti will not do well if exposed to too much moisture—either 
                                from watering or in the form of humidity. Therefore, it is unnecessary to spritz them or increase the humidity in their environment.</p>
                               
                                <h2 class="about-title">Fertilizer</h2>
                                <p class="about-text">Though not necessary, the ball cactus will respond well to fertilizer. 
                                    During the growing season fertilize with a cacti fertilizer mix and suspend feeding during the dormant winter period.</p> 
                                
                                <h2 class="about-title">Common Pests</h2>
                                <p class="about-text">Luckily, this plant won't typically fall to disease, but it can be a favorite for sucking pests like whiteflies, mealybugs, and aphids. Mealybugs may appear any time of the year. Aphids and whiteflies will 
                                    crawl on the plant in the spring and summer. To eliminate both, spray the cactus with a mix of equal parts rubbing alcohol and water.</p>
               
                                    <h2 class="about-title">Nicks in the Flesh</h2>
                                    <p class="about-text">
                                        If you spot openings in the plant's flesh, bacteria and fungus could be entering the plant through those small wounds. 
                                        If the spot around the wound has become mushy or is oozing liquid, use a sterilized cutting tool to dig out 
                                        that part of the flesh and let the area dry out. Make sure that no moisture touches the area so that the spot can heal and stay completely dry.
                                    </p>
