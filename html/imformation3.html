                        <p class="about-text">If you are looking for a large, tropical houseplant to add to your home then the Philodendron xanadu (Thaumatophyllum xanadu)
                             is an excellent choice. Easy to grow with lush foliage, this Brazilian native is known for its large, multi-lobed leaves and bushy growth habit. 

                            Until recently, this plant was considered a philodendron, hence its common name. However, in 2018 the philodendron xanadu, along with 
                            several other plants in the philodendron genus were reclassified into the newly created Thaumatophyllum genus.
                             Unfortunately, despite this reclassification, the xanadu is still 
                             considered toxic to pets and humans1 if ingested so take care with this houseplant if you have furry friends or small children at home.</p>
                       
                             <p class="about-text">
                            Philodendron xanadu is commonly confused with its close relative, the philodendron selloum (Thaumatophyllum selloum). Both have large, 
                            deeply lobed leaves, however, there are a few distinct differences that can help you tell these tropical plants apart. 
                            First, their growth habits are drastically different. The philodendron selloum, also known as philodendron bipinnatifidum, 
                            has a climbing growth habit, developing a thick trunk and large aerial roots as it matures. In contrast, the philodendron 
                            xanadu has a more shrub-like growth habit, remaining relatively compact and bushy without climbing. Second, the philodendron
                            selloum grows significantly larger than the xanadu—reaching several meters at maturity—while the xanadu usually tops out at around
                            five feet tall. Lastly, while both plants are known for their large foliage the xanadu 
                            has slightly smaller and narrower leaves than the selloum, although the shapes are very similar.

                        <h2 class="about-title"> Philodendron Xanadu Care</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Like many other plants in the Araceae family, the philodendron xanadu grows well in standard household conditions,
                             making it an excellent houseplant. It is relatively low-maintenance, enjoying medium to low light and semi-regular watering.
                              It does not require any pruning or aggressive repotting and is not prone to any particular pests, diseases, or other problems.
                             Here’s what you need to know about growing this tropical plant indoors.</p>
                      
                             <h2 class="about-title">Light</h2>
                      
                             <p class="about-text">As a forest understory plant, the xanadu is accustomed to receiving several hours of indirect, dappled light every day. As a result, it does best in bright, 
                            indirect light when grown indoors, although it can tolerate short
                             periods of low light as well. Be careful not to expose this tropical
                              plant to extended periods of intense, direct sunlight as it can develop leaf burn.

                        </div>
                        <h2 class="about-title">Soil</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Choose a soil mix that is rich, airy, and well-draining while still retaining some moisture. 
                            A combination of equal parts indoor potting soil, perlite, and orchid bark is a great option 
                            that you can easily whip up at home. Alternatively, 
                            any ready-made soil mix that is designed for aroids is a great option.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="about-title">Water</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Allow the soil to almost completely dry out between waterings and then water your philodendron xanadu thoroughly.
                             Ideally, you should be watering your plant until water drains from the pot’s drainage holes (houseplants should always be planted in pots with drainage holes).
                              Ensure all excess water has drained from the pot before returning it to its original location. 

                            Like most houseplants, it is generally better to under-water a philodendron xanadu than to overwater it. 
                            These tropical plants are sensitive to overwatering and can develop root rot if their roots are left sitting in water.</p>
                
                            <h2 class="about-title">Temperature and Humidity</h2>
                            <p class="about-text fs-20">For the most part, standard household temperature and humidity levels are fine for a philodendron xanadu. 
                                That being said, these tropical plants do enjoy humid conditions where available, so providing your xanadu with an extra source of humidity will always be appreciated. 
                                Try placing a small humidifier nearby or moving your plant to a naturally humid room such as a bathroom, kitchen, or laundry room.</p>
                               
                                <h2 class="about-title">Fertilizer</h2>
                                <p class="about-text">In spring and summer, fertilize your philodendron xanadu with a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month. Ensure you dilute the fertilizer before applying it to prevent fertilizer burn.</p> 
                                
                                <h2 class="about-title">Common Problems With Philodendron Xanadu</h2>
                                <p class="about-text">Philodendron xanadu are pretty low-maintenance houseplants. For the most part, these tropical plants are problem free. 
                                    However, there are a few common houseplant problems that can afflict the xanadu too. Keep an eye out for the following:</p>
               
                                    <h2 class="about-title">Yellow Leaves</h2>
                                    <p class="about-text">
                                        Leaves turning yellow can be perfectly normal and expected, or they can be a sign that something is wrong in your plant’s care. 
                                        If your plant develops one or two yellow leaves as it ages, there is probably nothing to worry about—especially if it's the oldest leaves that are turning yellow.
                                         However, if all of your plant's leaves suddenly start turning yellow and falling off then you probably have a bigger problem on your hands. <br> <br>
                                         Usually, yellow leaves are a sign of either underwatering or overwatering, but can also be an indication that your plant is not receiving enough light
                                          (and sometimes that it is receiving too much light). Additionally, yellow leaves can be a sign of temperature stress or a lack of humidity. So how can you determine what the ultimate culprit is?
                                          A close examination of your plant’s growing environment is the only thing that can be done to determine what the root cause of the problem may be.
